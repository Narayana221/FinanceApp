## 3. Desired Outcome

*   **User Clarity:** Users gain a clear understanding of their spending patterns.
*   **Actionable Plans:** Users receive simple, personalized monthly action plans to help them achieve their savings goals.

## 4. Core Features

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

*   **CSV Upload:**
    *   Users can upload bank CSV files (expected columns: date, description, amount, optional category).
    *   Python (using pandas) will parse and normalize the columns for consistency.

*   **Basic Analytics:**
    *   Aggregate spending by category and by month.
    *   Compute: total income, total expenses, net savings, and average monthly savings rate.

*   **Gemini "Cashflow Coach":**
    *   Prompt Gemini 2.5 Flash with a JSON summary of spending data and the user's specific savings goal (e.g., "save £300/month").
    *   The coach will provide:
        *   3-5 personalized recommendations.
        *   One simple "money habit" to try next month.
        *   Optional: an explanation of biggest spending leaks (e.g., subscriptions, food delivery).

*   **User Interface (UI):**
    *   Streamlit application.
    *   Includes a file uploader component.
    *   Displays key financial insights through a few charts (e.g., bar chart by category, monthly trend).
    *   Features a text area to show the "Coach Summary" generated by Gemini.

*   **File Operations:**
    *   Save the processed summary to a CSV/JSON file.
    *   Optionally export a "Monthly Plan" as a text/Markdown file containing the advice snapshot.

### Nice-to-Have Features (if time allows)

*   **Simple Goal Setting:**
    *   Users can input a monthly savings target.
    *   The coach will check if the last 3 months meet the target and suggest adjustments.

*   **Subscription Detection:**
    *   Identify transactions with recurring merchants and similar amounts.
    *   Summarize these subscriptions for the coach to comment on.

*   **Different "Tone Modes":**
    *   Allow users to select different communication tones for the coach (e.g., playful vs. serious), controlled via the prompt to Gemini.
